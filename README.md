I am pleased to share that I have successfully completed all the tasks assigned during my internship at CodSoft. These tasks encompassed a wide range of programming challenges and allowed me to develop and apply my skills effectively.

Task 1: Number Game
I successfully implemented a number guessing game, which involved generating random numbers, user input, and providing feedback on guesses. I took it a step further by incorporating features like limiting attempts, enabling multiple rounds, and tracking the user's score. This task not only enhanced my coding abilities but also improved my understanding of user interaction.

Task 2: Word Counter
For the Word Counter task, I created a program that efficiently counted words in user-provided text or files. I implemented features such as ignoring common words and providing statistics on word frequency and uniqueness. This task helped me work with string manipulation and data processing.

Task 3: Student Management System
The Student Management System project involved designing classes to represent students and managing them within a system. I developed a user interface, integrated data storage, and ensured proper input validation. This project improved my object-oriented programming skills and user interface design abilities.

Task 4: ATM Interface
Creating an ATM interface was a challenging but rewarding task. I successfully designed a user-friendly interface with options for withdrawing, depositing, and checking balances. I implemented transaction validation and messaging to enhance the user experience. This task strengthened my skills in handling user interactions and data validation.

Task 5: Address Book System
The Address Book System project involved creating a class to manage contacts and designing a user interface for interaction. I also integrated data storage and implemented input validation. This task improved my ability to work with collections and user interfaces.

Throughout this internship, I approached each task with the utmost professionalism and dedication, ensuring that I delivered high-quality solutions. I appreciate the opportunity to learn and grow during this internship, and I want to express my gratitude to the CodSoft team for providing me with these valuable experiences.

I am confident that the skills and knowledge I have gained during this internship will be invaluable in my future endeavors, and I look forward to applying them in real-world scenarios. Thank you for the guidance and support throughout this journey.

ABOUT COMPANY

CODSOFT is a vibrant and diverse community that brings together
individuals with similar objectives and ultimate goals. Our main focus
is on creating opportunities that span various areas, including
leadership development, learning, student engagement, and fostering
shared interests.

We believe in the power of leadership and its ability to drive positive
change. That's why we provide platforms and resources for our community
members to develop their leadership skills. Through mentorship programs,
workshops, and collaborative projects, we empower individuals to take on
leadership roles and make a difference in their respective fields.

TASK 1

1. Generate a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100.

2. Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.

3. Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess
is correct, too high, or too low.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number.

You can incorporate additional details as follows:

5. Limit the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.
6. Add the option for multiple rounds, allowing the user to play again.
7. Display the user's score, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.

NUMBER GAME

TASK 2

1. Prompt the user to enter a text or provide a file to count the words.
2. Read the input text or file and store it in a string.
3. Split the string into an array of words using space or punctuation as delimiters.
4. Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of words.
5. Iterate through the array of words and increment the counter for each word encountered.
6. Display the total count of words to the user.

You can further enhance the project by adding features such as:

7. Ignoring common words or stop words.
8. Providing statistics like the number of unique words or the frequency of each word.
9. Implementing input validation to handle empty inputs or file errors.
10. Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.

TASK 3

1.Create a class to represent the ATM machine.

2. Design the user interface for the ATM, including options such as withdrawing, depositing, and
checking the balance.

3. Implement methods for each option, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and
checkBalance().

4. Create a class to represent the user's bank account, which stores the account balance.

5. Connect the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the account
balance.

6. Validate user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).

7. Display appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure
of their transactions.
